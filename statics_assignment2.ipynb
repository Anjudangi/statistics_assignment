    "# Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean. A single extreme value can pull the mean in its direction, leading to a skewed representation of the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Median: The median is less affected by outliers. Since it's the middle value when data is ordered, extreme values have less impact on its calculation.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range since it is sensitive to extreme values. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",

    "# Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR is less affected by outliers compared to the range, as it focuses on the middle 50% of the data.\n",
